            Menopause is a natural biological process that marks the end of a woman's reproductive years. 
            It occurs when the ovaries stop producing eggs and hormone levels (especially estrogen and progesterone) decline.
            
            **Key Points:**
            - Natural process, not a disease
            - Usually occurs between ages 45-55
            - Marked by 12 consecutive months without menstruation
            - Affects every woman differently
